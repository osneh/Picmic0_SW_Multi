versions:
- 0.0.1 : Initial version written by Hugo Schott
            almost working.

- 0.2.1 : Software now modified and maintained by Matthieu Specht
            removed several bugs : bits order in bytes were swapped
            
- 0.2.2 : moved all the global variables in the head class
            changed the name of the script to sc_picmic_GUI_022

- 0.3.0 : made a new module : sc_picmic_highlevelfunc_10.py to get rid of all the global variables
	  implemented the picmic dac caracterisation
      
- 0.4.0 : Software modified to be able to run on win XP (RQ: the DAC caracterisation is not possible under win XP)

- 0.4.1 : added disable of the steering signals and the I2C buffer at startup and release of the USB link

- 0.4.2 : added the possibility to select the registers sent for the pulsing for both the pulsing and not pulsing pixels

- 0.5.0 / 04/11/2022: added the Picmic_Daq_Func_10 module in order to be able to include the acquisition of picmic in the slow control softwre to be able to perform automatic S curves plotting

- 0.5.1 / 10/11/2022 : modified the code to be able to run the slow control software on linux. The Picmic_Dac_Func-10 module has been disabled in this version,
                       because in the current state it is only functionnal in a windows environment.
                       
- 0.5.2 / 17/11/2022 : modified the main script to disable the implementation of the Analog discovery use ( which resulted in script crashing when the analog discovery is not installed)
                       added function result return for the FConnectToDueBoard function from the sc_picmic_highlevelfunc module
                       
- 0.5.3 / 22/11/2022 : fixed the bug on the TestMod Toggle button in the Steering tab
                       fixed the bug in the pulsing when sending all the pixels        

- 0.5.5 / 24/11/2022 : added a Modules.conf file storing the modules to be imported names in order to have only one name to modify in the whole software for each module ( multiple calling in differents modules)                       
                       Merged the Slow control and the DAQ sowtwares, in order to have a cleaner software.
